Algorithm Specifications:


Load Images:

- run Open File dialog and get the paths and names for all files
- initialize Sprite objects and populate master Sprite List


- Determine Canvas Size:
(current implementation makes a square with power of 2 edges)

- find the square root of the total pixel area of the images
- find the next greatest number that is a power of two
- set the canvas properties to new desired dimensions


- Sprite Arrangement:

- determine how many units can wholly fit within the desired canvas width
- create "cursor" for image insertion point
- - there are separate X and Y cursor values for determining the unit's placement on the canvas (in pixels)
- for each image in the list:
- - if it is the first image, simply set it's position to current cursor value (0,0)
- - otherwise:
- - - if the unit will not fit on the current row:
- - - - move cursor.Y down to the bottom of unit at the beginning of the row
- - - - move cursor.X back to 0
- - - - set unit's position
- - - otherwise:
- - - - add previous unit's width to cursor.X for proper offset amount
- - - - set unit's position


- create a DrawingVisual for the image and add it to the collection
